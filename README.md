# bosh-shell
This program is a Unix command shell called bosh. It allows users to enter Unix commands, and assumes commands are bounded by 127 characters and 9 command-line arguments. When a user inputs a "&amp;" at the end of a command, the command will run as a background process and output a message with its PID when it is complete.
